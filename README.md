# DevOps Intern Daily Warm-Up

A terminal-based daily review tool to build Linux muscle memory for aspiring DevOps engineers.  
Focused on the **80/20 rule**: only the commands and concepts that deliver 80% of real-world value, curated by my mentor [Mischa](https://x.com/mischavdburg). 
No fluff, no rarely-used trivia—just the essentials you need to be effective fast.

## How to Use

1. Make the script executable: `chmod +x warmup.sh`
2. Run it (anytime, it's your daily ritual): `./warmup.sh`

The script creates and uses a persistent sandbox at `~/sandbox`.
